Machine Learning - Neural Network Edition
- Using the available train and test datasets, I was able to run a neural network model.
- For the variables, the dependent variable was set to gender, while the independent variables were set to the month of hire and the Burn Rate from the training set.
- An average accuracy of 0.57 was achieved, which I've learned was a fairly average value to get in a real life dataset.  
- A general correlations matrix was generated to show what variables strongly correlated with each other.
